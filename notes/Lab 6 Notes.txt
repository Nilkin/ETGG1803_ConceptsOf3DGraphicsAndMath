Make a material class (Diffuse, Specular, Specular-power, ambient color)
Make a light source class (Position, Diffuse and Specular color, and attenuation)
We are given the Diffuse, Specular, colors and etc to pass into the material and light source class's

The Lighting Equation: numlights-1
Light_Color=Ambient_Color+E(Diffuse_Color[i]+Specular_Color[i])
                         i=0
x=0
for i in range(5,10)
x+=i**2+2

How to Calculate the Ambient Color:
Ambient_Color=A_L.pairwise_mul(A_M)
A_L= the color vector of the (scene's) ambient light
A_M= the color vector representing how much ambient light the material reflects

How to Calculate the Diffuse Color:
step1: Calculate the direction from hit point to light source(Normalize that)
Smaller angles== brighter illumination
Cos(angle) is closer to 1.0
use Dot Product
Light_direction=Light_position-Position
Light_direction.normalized
d_strength=Light_direction.normalized.dot(N_hat)  #N_hat is the up direction along the plane being hit
Diffuse_Color=d_strength*(D_l.pairwise_mul(D_m))

Need:
L_p:The Light position
P:The point we're illuminating
N_hat:The Normal vector at the hit point
D_l: The light's diffuse color
D_m: The material's diffuse color

How to Calculate the Specular Color:
We need:
Light_position
Point: point were illuminating
N: Normal vector at hit point
S_l: The light's specular color
S_m: The material's specular color
hardness: Scalar indicating the specular focus
C: camera's position

To get a sharper specularStrength as a function of Theta, the angle made by V and R
Square Cos(theta)
