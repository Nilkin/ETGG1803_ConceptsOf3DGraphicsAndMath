Most of the stuff that will be on the Exam will have a * before the title.
Rasterization Pipeline:
    To get the modified transformation
    Vertex*TransforMatrix = ModifiedVertex
    ModifiedVertex is a new space
    The rasterizer is simply a transformation of these faces

Major Spaces:
    Model Space: as the model appears relative to blender/maya axes
    Camera Space: objects are all relative to the rendering camera
    Projection/ClipSpace:Perspective Projection +Homogeneous Divide
        Orthogonal Projection
        Isometric Projection
    Screen Space: pixels(with depth)
